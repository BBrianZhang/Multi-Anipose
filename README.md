# Multi-Anipose

Multi-Anipose is an open-source toolkit for robust, markerless 3D pose estimation of multi-animal behavior from multiple camera views. It leverages the machine learning toolbox [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) to track keypoints in 2D, then triangulates across camera views to estimate 3D pose.

# Declaration

Multi-Anipose is a 3D pose estimation toolkit for multiple animals built on top of [Anipose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/anipose).
